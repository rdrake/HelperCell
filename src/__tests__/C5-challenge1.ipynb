    "This is a good start! You've correctly identified the need to get input from both players and have set up a logical structure using `if`/`elif` to determine the winner based on the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down where you can make improvements to match the challenge requirements exactly and ensure your program works correctly in all scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's my feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Successful Aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Takes Player Input:** You correctly use `input()` to get choices from Player 1 and Player 2.\n",
    "*   **Core Game Logic:** Your nested `if`/`elif` statements correctly determine the winner or a tie for many valid combinations of \"Rock\", \"Paper\", and \"Scissors\".\n",
    "*   **Identifies some Invalid Input:** Your final `else` statement correctly catches cases where `player1` makes an invalid choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Areas for Improvement (Priority: Getting the Right Output Next Time):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Missing Output: Player Choices:**\n",
    "    *   **Requirement:** \"Print both players’ choices and the result of the game.\"\n",
    "    *   **Your Code:** You only print the result (e.g., \"Player 1 wins\").\n",
    "    *   **To Fix:** Before your `if/elif` logic for determining the winner, you need to add lines to print what each player chose.\n",
    "    *   **Example (based on sample output):**\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        print(f\"Player 1 chose {player1}.\")\n",
    "        print(f\"Player 2 chose {player2}.\")\n",
    "        # ... then your win/loss/tie logic ...\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        (The `f` before the string helps you easily include variable values inside the print statement).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Comprehensive Invalid Input Handling:**\n",
    "    *   **Requirement:** \"Ensure the inputs mispelled or not respecting the case... will result in the follow output: `\\\"ERROR: Invalid choice.\\\"`\"\n",
    "    *   **Your Code:** Your current `else` block (`else: print(\"ERROR: invalid choice\")`) only catches if `player1` is invalid.\n",
    "    *   **Logical Issue:** If `player1` makes a valid choice (e.g., \"Rock\") but `player2` makes an invalid choice (e.g., \"scissor\" instead of \"Scissors\"), your program currently won't print anything at all. It needs to catch invalid choices from *either* player.\n",
    "    *   **To Fix:** It's best to validate both players' inputs at the very beginning of your program. If either input is invalid, print the error message and *stop* the game logic. Only proceed to determine the winner if both inputs are valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Suggested modification for invalid input handling:**\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        player1 = input(\"Player 1, choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors:\")\n",
    "        player2 = input(\"Player 2, choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors:\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        valid_choices = [\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "        if player1 not in valid_choices or player2 not in valid_choices:\n",
    "            print(\"ERROR: Invalid choice.\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            # ONLY if both inputs are valid, proceed with the game logic\n",
    "            # Add the lines to print player choices here first:\n",
    "            print(f\"Player 1 chose {player1}.\")\n",
    "            print(f\"Player 2 chose {player2}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "            # Now, your existing if/elif structure (without the final 'else')\n",
    "            if player1 == \"Rock\":\n",
    "                if player2 == \"Paper\":\n",
    "                    print(\"Player 2 wins!\") # Remember the exclamation mark\n",
    "                elif player2 == \"Scissors\":\n",
    "                    print(\"Player 1 wins!\") # Remember the exclamation mark\n",
    "                elif player2 == \"Rock\":\n",
    "                    print(\"Player 1 and 2 tie.\") # Check exact wording\n",
    "            # ... and so on for Paper and Scissors branches ...\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Exact Wording and Punctuation for Output:**\n",
    "    *   **Requirement:** Pay close attention to the exact output strings for wins, ties, and errors.\n",
    "    *   **Your Code vs. Sample:**\n",
    "        *   `\"Player 1 wins\"` vs. `\"Player 1 wins!\"` (Missing exclamation mark).\n",
    "        *   `\"player 1 and player 2 tie\"` vs. `\"Player 1 and 2 tie.\"` (Capitalization, \"and 2\" instead of \"and player 2\", and missing period).\n",
    "        *   `\"ERROR: invalid choice\"` vs. `\"ERROR: Invalid choice.\"` (Capitalization of \"Invalid\" and missing period).\n",
    "    *   **To Fix:** Adjust your `print()` statements to match the sample output exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of an Invalid Input Scenario (to help you test):\n",
    "\n",
    "If `player1 = \"Rock\"` and `player2 = \"scissor\"` (lowercase 's'), your current code will print nothing. With the suggested fix for invalid input, it should correctly print:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ERROR: Invalid choice.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these points, your program will correctly meet all the requirements of the challenge! You're on the right track!"
