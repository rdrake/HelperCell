    "Great job on this challenge! You've successfully implemented the core logic for calculating the late fees and determining when a suspension warning is needed. Your use of `if/elif/else` statements is correct for handling the different fee tiers, and you've correctly calculated the `total_fee`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's refine a couple of things to make your output exactly match the sample and ensure the tone is appropriate for a library message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Output Message Wording:** The wording for the fee display is slightly different from the sample output. While your message conveys the same information, it's good practice to match the sample output exactly when provided.\n",
    "    *   **Your output:** `Unfortunately you have {number_books} overdue books for {days_overdue} days. Therefore your total overdue fee is: ${total_fee}`\n",
    "    *   **Sample output:** `You have {number_books} overdue books for {days_overdue} days. The total late fee is: ${total_fee}`\n",
    "    *   **Recommendation:** Adjust your `print` statement to match the sample text more closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Warning Message Wording and Tone:** The warning message also differs from the sample output and contains some informal language (\"you fool!\"). In programming assignments, it's crucial to match specified output text precisely, especially for warning or error messages, as they are often part of a system's expected behavior.\n",
    "    *   **Your warning:** `WARNING!! Your account is close to facing suspension due to a maximized number of overdue books and days. consider being more responsible you fool!`\n",
    "    *   **Sample warning:** `WARNING: Your account may be suspended due to excessive late returns!`\n",
    "    *   **Recommendation:** Change the warning message to match the sample text. This ensures your program behaves exactly as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Clarity on Fee Calculation (Minor Point, but good to understand):** You've correctly interpreted the \"Fee Per Book\" in the table as a *daily* fee per book, which is why your calculation `number_books * fee_per_book * days_overdue` works perfectly for the sample cases. This shows a good understanding of the problem statement!\n",

    "Let's refine it a bit to meet all the requirements for the challenge exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Handling Invalid Choices (Most Important!):**\n",
    "    The biggest missing piece is handling cases where players enter something other than \"Rock\", \"Paper\", or \"Scissors\", or if they misspell or use incorrect casing (e.g., \"rock\" instead of \"Rock\").\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **The Problem:** Currently, if a player types \"rock\" (lowercase), your code won't recognize it as \"Rock\", and it might incorrectly fall into the `else` block, leading to Player 2 winning even if Player 1 intended to play Rock. If a player types \"banana\", it would also fall into the `else` block and declare Player 2 the winner.\n",
    "    *   **Requirement:** The challenge states: `\"ERROR: Invalid choice.\"` should be displayed for misspelled or incorrect case inputs.\n",
    "    *   **How to Fix:**\n",
    "        1.  **Standardize Input:** Immediately after `input()`, convert the player's choice to a consistent format. A good way to do this is using the `.capitalize()` string method (e.g., `\"rock\".capitalize()` becomes `\"Rock\"`).\n",
    "        2.  **Validate Input:** Before checking for winners, check if *both* player's choices are one of the three valid options (\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\"). If either player's choice is invalid, print the error message and end the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Output Messages:**\n",
    "    Your messages are fun and creative, but the challenge exercise specifies exact messages for the outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Tie Message:**\n",
    "        *   Your code: `print(\"It's a tie!! WOMP WOMP try again...\")`\n",
    "        *   Required: `\"Player 1 and 2 tie.\"`\n",
    "    *   **Win Messages:**\n",
    "        *   Your code: `print(\"Player 1 is the winner winner chicken dinner! better luck next time player 2...\")` and `print(\"Player 2 steals the victory! get better player 1!\")`\n",
    "        *   Required (based on sample output): `\"Player 1 wins!\"` and `\"Player 2 wins!\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Clarity of Input Prompts:**\n",
    "    While your prompts are descriptive, to match the sample output exactly, the input prompts could be simplified.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Your prompts: `\"Player 1, Decide your FATE!:\"` and `\"Player 2, Select your WEAPON!:\"`\n",
    "    *   Sample prompt: `\"Player 1, choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors:\"`\n",
