    "### General Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- This test duration is **80 minutes**.\n",
    "- Canvas allows you to submit several times, we will only grade the latest submission.\n",
    "- The invigilators will be available during the test to answer general clarification questions. The invigilators will not help you with solutions, *clarifications only*.\n",
    "- You should take this test in person (classroom or test centre according to your registered accommodations), only tests of individuals in attendance will be graded.\n",
    "    - The invigilator will check everyone's photo ID and register on the attendance sheet.\n",
    "- This is an **individual** programming test. \n",
    "- Do **NOT** copy from others, do **NOT** post the test instructions, and do **NOT** share your answer with others. \n",
    "- Remember, copying and pasting from any other person or online resources is also considered **plagiarism**. \n",
    "- You are only allowed to communicate to the invigilator regarding this programming test. Any other communication (besides the invigilator) is an **academic misconduct**.\n",
    "- You may access only your own past 1040U Fall 2025 materials already present in your JupyterHub environment before the test begins.(No uploading or adding new files during the test.) \n",
    "- You are **NOT** allowed to exchange materials or to communicate with other students regarding this assessment or its solution.\n",

    "- You are required to add your full name and student ID this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Tips/Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even if you have a partial solution, you should submit it. Use comments to supplement the solution, use English to explain your intention, even if your code is not running at the moment of submission -- partial grades will be assigned to general strategies to assess your problem-solving skills and computational thinking.\n",
    "- If you are having trouble with a task, skip it, work on the next tasks, then come back for it. \n",
    "- Refer to the course material and the practice questions for similar problems.\n",
    "- Before you start, make sure you understand the problem first, then start thinking about the solution.\n",
    "- Focus on each of the enumerated tasks/steps at a time.\n",
    "- Use `#comments` to guide yourself on steps you need to take so you don't forget and also gives you a clearer picture of what to do.\n",

    "Hello! Thanks for submitting your work. First, I have to say this sucks, just kidding, you're doing great!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've clearly understood the logic of iterating through the players and their averages to categorize them, which is a great start! However, there are a few key areas we need to refine to make sure your code produces the correct output and meets the requirements of the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Getting the Right Output: Initializing `category1` and `category2`\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing for getting the correct output is how you initialize `category1` and `category2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   You currently set `category1 = [threshold]` and `category2 = [batting_avgs]`. This means your `category1` list will *always* start with the `threshold` value, and your `category2` list will *always* start with the entire `batting_avgs` list.\n",
    "*   The goal of these lists is to store the *names of players*. So, they should start empty, and you'll add players' names to them during the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To fix this, simply initialize them as empty lists:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "category1 = []   # This list will hold names of players whose average is >= threshold\n",
    "category2 = []   # This list will hold names of players whose average is < threshold\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you make this change, your output will correctly show only player names in the categories, without the extra numbers or lists at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Writing Code as a Function (Main Task Point)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main instruction for Task 1 was to refactor the given code into a **function**. A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a specific action. This helps you avoid repeating code, makes your programs easier to read, and allows you to test different inputs easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "You currently have the categorization logic repeated three times for your \"test cases\". When you want to run the same logic with different inputs (like different thresholds, or even different players and averages), a function is perfect for this! It means you write the logic once, and then just *call* the function with your new inputs whenever you need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's a basic example of how you'd define a function and then call it with your variables as arguments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sort_players_by_average(all_players, player_averages, cutoff_value):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Categorizes players based on their batting averages against a cutoff value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        all_players (list): A list of player names.\n",
    "        player_averages (list): A list of batting averages corresponding to the players.\n",
    "        cutoff_value (float): The threshold for categorizing players.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        tuple: A tuple containing two lists:\n",
    "               - The first list contains players whose average is at or above the cutoff.\n",
    "               - The second list contains players whose average is below the cutoff.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    # Initializing empty lists to store categorized player names\n",
    "    high_performers = []\n",
    "    low_performers = []\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Iterating through each player and their batting average\n",
    "    for i in range(len(all_players)):\n",
    "        # If the batting average is at or above the cutoff, they're high performers\n",
    "        if player_averages[i] >= cutoff_value:\n",
    "            high_performers.append(all_players[i])\n",
    "        # Otherwise, they are low performers\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            low_performers.append(all_players[i]) \n",
    "    \n",
    "    return (high_performers, low_performers)\n",

    "print(f\"Test Case 2 Output: {result_case2}\")\n",
    "# Expected output: (['Alice', 'Charlie'], ['Bob'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice how `players`, `batting_avgs`, and `threshold` become the *arguments* (inputs) to the function. This makes it very reusable, as you only write the categorization logic once!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Test Cases with Expected Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The task asked for 3 test cases *with expected outputs*. When you write a function, you call it with specific inputs, and then you state what you *expect* the function to return for those inputs. You didn't provide the expected outputs for your repeated code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `sort_players_by_average` function example above, an expected output would look like this:\n",
    "*   **Input:** `all_players = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"]`, `player_averages = [0.400, 0.220, 0.350]`, `cutoff_value = 0.300`\n",
    "*   **Expected Output:** `(['Alice', 'Charlie'], ['Bob'])`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Comments and Variable Purpose (`??`)\n",
    "\n",
    "You did a good job filling in some of the `??` comments! Let's just refine the ones for `category1` and `category2` to reflect their correct purpose once they are initialized as empty lists, and for general clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `threshold = 0.300 # represents the minimum batting average required for the top category`\n",
    "*   `category1 = []   # represents the list of players whose batting average is at or above the threshold`\n",
    "*   `category2 = []   # represents the list of players whose batting average is below the threshold`\n",
    "*   `# Initializing empty lists to store categorized player names` (for the block before the loop, if you keep variables outside the function)\n",
    "*   `# Iterating through each player and their batting average to categorize them` (for the loop comment)\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep practicing, you're on the right track! Functions are a fundamental concept in programming, and once you get the hang of them, your code will be much more organized and powerful. Let me know if you have any questions!"

    "Hey there!\n",
    "\n",
    "Slay! It's great that you're thinking about how to categorize players based on their batting averages, and you've got a good handle on the core logic for checking the threshold. Let's make sure we're also meeting all the requirements for writing functions and setting up test cases correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some feedback to help you out for next time:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Areas for Improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Defining a Function:** The biggest step you missed here was actually defining the code as a function. The prompt asked you to wrap your logic within a function so it can be called multiple times with different inputs.\n",
    "2.  **Correct List Initialization:** You accidentally started `category1` and `category2` with values instead of making them empty lists. These lists are meant to *collect* player names, so they should start empty.\n",
    "3.  **Test Case Structure:** For test cases, instead of copying and pasting the entire script multiple times, you should call your function with different arguments and then state what you *expect* the output to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Feedback and Corrections:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Function Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt specifically asked you to turn your code into a function. A function allows you to reuse a block of code with different inputs without rewriting it every time. You need to use the `def` keyword, give your function a name, specify its parameters (arguments), and use `return` to send back the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Code:** You just had the script running directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correction Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def classify_batters(players, batting_avgs, threshold):\n",
    "    # Function documentation (optional, but good practice!)\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Classifies players into two categories based on their batting average\n",
    "    against a given threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        players (list): A list of player names.\n",
    "        batting_avgs (list): A list of batting averages corresponding to the players.\n",
    "        threshold (float): The batting average cutoff for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        tuple: A tuple containing two lists:\n",
    "               - The first list contains players meeting or exceeding the threshold.\n",
    "               - The second list contains players below the threshold.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    # ... (your categorization logic goes here)\n",
    "    # Don't forget to return the result!\n",
    "    category_high = []\n",
    "    category_low = []\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for i in range(len(players)):\n",
    "        if batting_avgs[i] >= threshold:\n",
    "            category_high.append(players[i])\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            category_low.append(players[i])\n",
    "            \n",
    "    return (category_high, category_low)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice how `players`, `batting_avgs`, and `threshold` are now *parameters* of the function. This makes your function reusable!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Correct List Initialization for `category1` and `category2`\n",
    "\n",
    "You initialized `category1` with `[threshold]` and `category2` with `[batting_avgs]`. This means your lists would start with these values already in them, which isn't what we want for lists that are meant to *collect* player names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Code:**\n",

    "### Feedback for Part 1: Categorizing Players by Batting Average\n",
    "\n",
    "You've successfully applied the logic of checking batting averages against a threshold! You're using loops and conditional statements correctly to compare each player's average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of points to help you improve for next time:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Avoid Repeating Code (Use a Function!):** You've copied and pasted the entire block of code (variables, loop, print statement) four times, once for each test case. This is a common situation where writing a **function** can be very helpful!\n",
    "    *   **Why it's better:** If you ever need to change how the categorization works (e.g., change `if batting_avgs[i] >= threshold:` to `> threshold`), you would only need to change it in one place (inside the function), rather than in multiple places. It also makes your code much cleaner and easier to read.\n",
    "    *   **How to do it:** You can wrap your core logic inside a function that takes `players`, `batting_avgs`, and `threshold` as arguments. Then, you just call this function with different test case values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **List Initialization:** When you initialize `category1 = [threshold]` and `category2 = [batting_avgs]`, you're adding the `threshold` value and the *entire* `batting_avgs` list as the *first elements* of your `category1` and `category2` lists, respectively.\n",
    "    *   If your goal is for `category1` and `category2` to *only* contain the names of the players, you should start with empty lists: `category1 = []` and `category2 = []`.\n",
    "    *   **Current Output Example (for the first case):**\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        ([0.3, 'Gibson', 'Blake'], [[0.285, 0.198, 0.341, 0.25, 0.305], 'Shigeno', 'Silva', 'Williams Jr.'])\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        Notice `0.3` and the full `[0.285, ...]` list at the beginning of your output lists.\n",

    "        (['Gibson', 'Blake'], ['Shigeno', 'Silva', 'Williams Jr.'])\n",

    "### Part 1: Batting Average Categorization\n",
    "\n",
    "You've correctly used a loop to go through each player and their batting average, comparing it to the `threshold`. That's a great start! However, there are a couple of things we can adjust to make sure you get the exact output you're looking for and to make your code more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Initializing Your Category Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue:**\n",
    "When you initialize `category1` and `category2`, you're adding the `threshold` and the entire `batting_avgs` list as the first elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "category1 = [threshold]     # This adds the threshold value to the list\n",
    "category2 = [batting_avgs]  # This adds the entire batting_avgs list to the list\n",
    "```\n",
    "This means your `category1` will always start with the `threshold` number, and `category2` will always start with the full list of `batting_avgs`, regardless of which players fall into those categories. The goal is likely to have these lists contain *only* player names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to fix it:**\n",
    "If you want these lists to store only player names, you should initialize them as empty lists. This way, you start fresh and only append the players who meet the criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Before (student's approach):\n",
    "# If you want a list of apples, but start with an orange:\n",
    "fruits_list = [\"Orange\"]\n",
    "fruits_list.append(\"Apple A\")\n",
    "fruits_list.append(\"Apple B\")\n",
    "# Output: [\"Orange\", \"Apple A\", \"Apple B\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# After (recommended approach):\n",

    "fruits_list.append(\"Apple B\")\n",
    "# Output: [\"Apple A\", \"Apple B\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying this to your code, you would change:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "category1 = []   # This list will now start empty, ready for players above the threshold\n",
    "category2 = []   # This list will also start empty, ready for players below the threshold\n",

    "#### 2. Avoiding Repeated Code (Using Functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue:**\n",
    "You've written the same block of code (defining variables, the loop, and printing the result) four separate times for your initial run and then for each test case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to fix it:**\n",
    "Repeating code like this makes your program longer, harder to read, and difficult to update if you need to make a change (you'd have to change it in multiple places!). A core programming principle is \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" (DRY).\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to handle this is to put the logic into a **function**. A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. You can then call this function whenever you need to perform that task with different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Without a function (repeated code):\n",
    "# Calculate area for rectangle 1\n",
    "length1 = 5\n",
    "width1 = 3\n",
    "area1 = length1 * width1\n",
    "print(f\"Area 1: {area1}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate area for rectangle 2\n",
    "length2 = 10\n",
    "width2 = 4\n",
    "area2 = length2 * width2\n",
    "print(f\"Area 2: {area2}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# With a function (DRY):\n",
    "def calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Calculates the area of a rectangle.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return length * width\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now call the function for different rectangles:\n",
    "print(f\"Area 1: {calculate_rectangle_area(5, 3)}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Area 2: {calculate_rectangle_area(10, 4)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For your problem, you could define a function like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def sort_players_by_avg(players_list, batting_avgs_list, threshold_value):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Categorizes players into two lists based on their batting average\n",
    "    compared to a given threshold.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    above_threshold = []\n",
    "    below_threshold = []\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i in range(len(players_list)):\n",
    "        if batting_avgs_list[i] >= threshold_value:\n",
    "            above_threshold.append(players_list[i])\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            below_threshold.append(players_list[i])\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (above_threshold, below_threshold)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now you can run your test cases much more cleanly:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test Case 1:\n",
    "players_data = [\"Shigeno\", \"Silva\", \"Gibson\", \"Williams Jr.\", \"Blake\"]\n",
    "avgs_data = [0.285, 0.198, 0.341, 0.250, 0.305]\n",
    "my_threshold = 0.300\n",
    "result_tuple = sort_players_by_avg(players_data, avgs_data, my_threshold)\n",
    "print(result_tuple)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test Case 2:\n",
    "my_threshold = 0.400 # Just change the threshold for this test\n",
    "result_tuple = sort_players_by_avg(players_data, avgs_data, my_threshold)\n",
    "print(result_tuple)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This makes your code much more readable, maintainable, and professional!\n",

    "Great job on structuring your function using the flag technique, `is_valid`! Your comments are clear, and your test cases demonstrate a good understanding of various scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've correctly implemented most of the required checks, such as:\n",
    "*   Ensuring the player isn't already in the lineup.\n",
    "*   Checking if the lineup is full.\n",
    "*   Verifying if the player is on the injured list.\n",
    "*   Validating if the desired position is in `ALLOWED_POSITIONS` and not already taken.\n",
    "*   Checking for parallel list lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a couple of small things to adjust for full correctness and best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Missing Position Format Validation**: The prompt specified that \"The position string must contain **only uppercase letters and digits** (no lowercase, no spaces -- You may use the built-in function `isalnum()` to test this).\" Your code doesn't currently include this check.\n",
    "    *   **To fix this**: You'll need to add another `if` condition to check if `desired_position` consists only of alphanumeric characters. If it doesn't, `is_valid` should be set to `False`.\n",
    "    *   **Example of how to add this check**:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        # ... inside your function ...\n",
    "        # Check if desired position contains only uppercase letters and digits\n",
    "        if is_valid and not desired_position.isalnum():\n",
    "            is_valid = False\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    *   **Consider adding a test case** like this to ensure this rule is covered:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        print(validate_starter_add(\"Mike\", \"cf\", [\"Ben\", \"Clara\"], [\"1B\", \"SS\"], 9, []))\n",
    "        # Expected: False (desired position \"cf\" is not uppercase)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Redundant Global Variable**: You've defined `ALLOWED_POSITIONS` globally at the top of the file, and then you've redefined it *again* inside your function. It's best practice to use the globally defined `ALLOWED_POSITIONS` directly within your function without redefining it. This ensures consistency and avoids unnecessary memory allocation.\n",
    "    *   **To fix this**: Simply remove the line `ALLOWED_POSITIONS = [\"P\",\"C\",\"1B\",\"2B\",\"3B\",\"SS\",\"LF\",\"CF\",\"RF\",\"DH\"]` from inside your `validate_starter_add` function. Python will then automatically look for the variable in the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you implement the `isalnum()` check, your function will fully meet all the requirements! Keep up the great work!"
