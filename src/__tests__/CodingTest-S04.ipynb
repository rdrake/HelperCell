The invigilators will not help you with solutions, *clarifications only*.\n- You should take this test in person (classroom or test centre according to your registered accommodations), only tests of individuals in attendance will be graded.\n    - The invigilator will check everyone's photo ID and register on the attendance sheet.\n- This is an **individual** programming test. \n- Do **NOT** copy from others, do **NOT** post the test instructions, and do **NOT** share your answer with others. \n- Remember, copying and pasting from any other person or online resources is also considered **plagiarism**. \n- You are only allowed to communicate to the invigilator regarding this programming test. Any other communication (besides the invigilator) is an **academic misconduct**.\n- You may access only your own past 1040U Fall 2025 materials already present in your JupyterHub environment before the test begins.(No uploading or adding new files during the test.) \n- You are **NOT** allowed to exchange materials or to communicate with other students regarding this assessment or its solution.\n- You are **NOT** allowed to perform web searches during the test, including but not limited to w3 schools, chatGPT, etc.\n- You are **NOT** allowed to use ANY communication or file sharing apps, including, but not limited to, Discord, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, Teams, Slack, SMS, etc.\n    - Please make sure to quit and exit any applications that may fall under this category.\n- Any form of academic misconduct will be treated accordingly to the university's code of conduct.\n\n**Requirements**\n\n- You are required to document your code using comments. Failing to do so may result in deductions.\n- You are required to submit **both** PDF/HTML **and** ipynb versions of your solution. Failing to do so may result in deductions.\n- You are required to add your full name and student ID this file.\n\n**General Tips/Strategies**\n\n- Even if you have a partial solution, you should submit it. Use comments to supplement the solution, use English to explain your intention, even if your code is not running at the moment of submission -- partial grades will be assigned to general strategies to assess your problem-solving skills and computational thinking.\n- If you are having trouble with a task, skip it, work on the next tasks, then come back for it. \n- Refer to the course material and the practice questions for similar problems.\n- Before you start, make sure you understand the problem first, then start thinking about the solution.\n- Focus on each of the enumerated tasks/steps at a time.\n- Use `#comments` to guide yourself on steps you need to take so you don't forget and also gives you a clearer picture of what to do.\n- Most importantly, **do not panic**, **start by understanding the exercise instructions** and **ask for clarification** if you need it.\n\n##### Good luck!

The player is **not already** in `lineup_players`.  \n2. The current lineup has **fewer than `max_starters`** players.  \n3. The player is **not** in the `injured_list`.  \n4. The player’s `desired_position` is **valid and available**.  \n   - Valid positions are:  \n    | Position Code | Full description       |\n    |---------------|--------------------------|\n    | P             | Pitcher                 |\n    | C             | Catcher                 |\n    | 1B            | First Base              |\n    | 2B            | Second Base             |\n    | 3B            | Third Base              |\n    | SS            | Shortstop               |\n    | LF            | Left Field              |\n    | CF            | Center Field            |\n    | RF            | Right Field             |\n    | DH            | Designated Hitter       |\n   - The position string must contain **only uppercase letters and digits** (no lowercase, no spaces -- You may use the built-in function `isalnum()` to test this).  \n   - The position must **not already be taken** in the current lineup.  \n5. The input lists `lineup_players` and `lineup_positions` must have the **same length**.  \n   - If they don’t match, treat the input as invalid and return `False`.\n\n\n\n### TASK 2 Programming Task\n\nWrite a function named `validate_starter_add` that determines whether a player can be added to the starting lineup based on the **requirements listed above**.\n\nYour function should:\n\n1. Receive **six arguments**:\n   - `player`: a string containing the player’s name  \n   - `desired_position`: a string representing the position the player wants to play  \n   - `lineup_players`: a list of player names currently in the lineup  \n   - `lineup_positions`: a list of position codes currently assigned in the lineup  \n   - `max_starters`: an integer representing the maximum number of starters allowed  \n   - `injured_list`: a list of player names currently injured  \n\n2. Use the **flag technique** to determine eligibility.  \n   - `True` value for valid cases, `False` otherwise.  \n   - **Return** the final value of the flag at the end of the function.\n\n3. Include **clear comments** explaining your logic and reasoning.\n\n4. Provide at least **three (3) test cases** showing different possible outcomes, each with a short **comment describing the expected result**.\n\n\n**Tips**\n- You may use the built-in function `isalnum()` to test if a string only contains letters and numbers.\n- You may use the given global variable `ALLOWED_POSITIONS` to help validate your position code.","metadata":{}},{"id":"56264497-6a9b-4d33-b9fa-41cd89c47caa","cell_type":"code","source":"# You may use this variable in your function to help validate the desired position code\nALLOWED_POSITIONS = [\"P\",\"C\",\"1B\",\"2B\",\"3B\",\"SS\",\"LF\",\"CF\",\"RF\",\"DH\"]\n\n# your solution\n# Initializing variables for the function\nplayer = \"\"\ndesired_position = \"\"\nlineup_players = []\nlineup_positions = []\nmax_starters = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\ninjured_list = []\ndesired_position.isalnum()\n\n# defining the function as \"validate_starter_add\"\ndef validate_starter_add(player, desired_position, line_players, lineup_positions, max_starters, injured_list):\n# The player is not already in lineup_players. \n    if player not in line_players:\n        True\n    else:\n        False\n# The current lineup has fewer than max_starters players.\n    if list(line_players) < list(max_starters):\n        True\n    else:\n        False\n# The player is not in the injured_list.\n    if player not in injured_list:\n        True\n    else:\n        False\n# The player’s desired_position is valid and available\n    if player in desired_position:\n        True\n    else:\n        False\n# making sure that both lengths of lists should be the same\n    if len(lineup_players) == len(lineup_positions):\n        True\n    else:\n        False\n    return\n\"\"\"\ntrie to initialize the code in order to put the input as true or false. then return the value to the function.\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"trusted":false},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":"'\\ntrie to initialize the code in order to put the input as true or false. then return the value to the function.\\n'"},"execution_count":72,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"execution_count":72},{"id":"0b481e29-857d-4d8c-bf30-453ec083466a","cell_type":"code","source":"# test cases -
