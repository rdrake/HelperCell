    "This is an excellent solution! You've done a fantastic job of meeting all the requirements of the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of your code and why it's so good:\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Correctness:** Your program correctly determines the winner for all possible valid inputs, handles ties, and precisely identifies when an input is invalid. This is crucial for a working game!\n",
    "*   **Input Validation:** Your approach to validating inputs *first* (`if player1_choice not in valid_choices or player2_choice not in valid_choices:`) is a very robust and smart way to structure your code. It prevents the rest of your logic from needing to worry about malformed data and directly addresses requirement #7.\n",
    "*   **Clarity and Readability:**\n",
    "    *   You used meaningful variable names like `player1_choice` and `valid_choices`.\n",
    "    *   Your use of f-strings (`print(f\"Player 1 chose {player1_choice}.\")`) makes the output clear and easy to read.\n",
    "    *   The conditional logic for determining the winner is well-organized and easy to follow.\n",
    "*   **Meeting Requirements:** You successfully implemented every requirement from the prompt, including the specific output messages for ties and invalid choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Points of Praise\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`valid_choices` List:** Creating a list `valid_choices = [\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\"]` is an excellent practice. It makes your code maintainable and easy to extend if you ever wanted to add more options to the game. It also makes your input validation very clean.\n",
    "*   **Comprehensive Logic:** Your `elif` conditions cover all winning scenarios for Player 1, and the final `else` correctly catches all scenarios where Player 2 would win, after ties and Player 1's wins are accounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minor Suggestion (Optional, for future refinement)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Redundant Output of Options:** You have `print(\"Choose from: Rock, Paper, Scissors\")` and then the `input()` prompts also list the options. While not incorrect, the `print` statement listing the options at the beginning is slightly redundant because the input prompts immediately follow and also tell the user what to choose. You could choose to remove the `print(\"Choose from: Rock, Paper, Scissors\")` line, as the input prompts are clear enough:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    print(\"Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!\")\n",
    "    # print(\"Choose from: Rock, Paper, Scissors\") # This line is optional as input prompts also list options\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Get player choices\n",
    "    player1_choice = input(\"Player 1, choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors: \")\n",
    "    player2_choice = input(\"Player 2, choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors: \")\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a minor stylistic observation, and your current code is perfectly fine. You've clearly grasped the core concepts of input, conditionals, and logical comparison, which are fundamental to programming. Keep up the great work!"

    "This is a fantastic start to building a classic game! You've got a lot of the core logic down perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some feedback to help you make your game even more robust and user-friendly:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Great Structure!**\n",
    "    *   Your introductory messages are fun and engaging.\n",
    "    *   You clearly label input and output steps.\n",
    "    *   Your `if`/`elif`/`else` structure for determining the winner is logically sound and easy to follow. You've correctly identified the tie condition, all Player 1 winning conditions, and then used the `else` to catch all Player 2 wins, which is a smart way to simplify the logic!\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Key Improvement: Handling Input Variations (Case Sensitivity)**\n",
    "    *   **The Problem**: Right now, your code expects the input to be *exactly* \"Rock\", \"Paper\", or \"Scissors\" (with the first letter capitalized). If a player types \"rock\", \"PAPER\", \"scissors\", or any other capitalization, your `if` conditions won't match, and the game won't work as expected. For example, if Player 1 types \"rock\" and Player 2 types \"Scissors\", Player 2 will incorrectly win.\n",
    "    *   **Why it Matters**: Users might not always type things in with the exact capitalization you expect, and we want our programs to be flexible!\n",
    "    *   **The Fix**: You can easily fix this by converting the player's input to a consistent case (like all lowercase or all capitalized) right after they input it. The `.lower()` method is great for this!\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Input your choice\n",
    "    player_1_raw = input(\"Player 1, Decide your FATE!: \")\n",
    "    player_1 = player_1_raw.lower() # Convert to lowercase for consistent comparison\n",
    "\n",

    "    player_2 = player_2_raw.lower() # Convert to lowercase for consistent comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Print selected choices (you can still print the original raw input for a nicer display)\n",
    "    print(f\"player 1 chose {player_1_raw}, while player 2 chose {player_2_raw}. let's see who's LUCKY!!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Who won - now all comparisons should be against lowercase strings\n",
    "    if player_1 == player_2:\n",
    "         print(\"It's a tie!! WOMP WOMP try again...\")\n",
    "    elif (player_1 == \"rock\" and player_2 == \"scissors\") or \\\n",
    "             (player_1 == \"scissors\" and player_2 == \"paper\") or \\\n",
    "             (player_1 == \"paper\" and player_2 == \"rock\"):\n",
    "        print(\"Player 1 is the winner winner chicken dinner! better luck next time player 2...\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Player 2 steals the victory! get better player 1!\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    (Note: I used `player_1_raw` to keep the original input for the print statement, and `player_1` for the actual game logic. This is a common pattern!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output with the suggested change (if Player 1 types \"rock\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE MOST CLASSICAL GAME KNOWN TO MANKIND. so classical, that your ancestors used it to decide who would eat the last bit of wolly mammoth!\n",

    "Hi there! This is a great start to your Rock, Paper, Scissors game! You've successfully implemented the core logic for determining the winner based on the classic rules, and your game flow from introduction to outcome is clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through your submission and see where we can make some improvements to match all the requirements and make your code even more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Feedback on Your Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Input Validation (Most Important!)**\n",
    "    *   **The Problem:** The challenge specifically asked for error handling if the input is misspelled or doesn't respect the case (e.g., \"rock\" instead of \"Rock\"). Your current code doesn't handle this. If a player types \"rock\" or \"Stone\", it will fall into the `else` block, incorrectly declaring Player 2 the winner, instead of printing `\"ERROR: Invalid choice.\"`.\n",
    "    *   **How to Fix It:** You need to check if the player's input is one of the valid options (\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\") *before* you compare them. A good strategy is to:\n",
    "        *   Convert the user's input to a consistent case (e.g., all lowercase using `.lower()`, or capitalize the first letter using `.capitalize()`).\n",
    "        *   Check if the cleaned input is in a list of valid choices.\n",
    "        *   If it's not valid, print the error message and perhaps exit the program or re-prompt the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Specific Output Messages**\n",
    "    *   **The Problem:** The challenge specified exact output messages for choices, ties, and wins. Your current messages are fun and conversational, but they don't match the required output.\n",
    "        *   **Required Tie Message:** `\"Player 1 and 2 tie.\"`\n",
    "        *   **Your Tie Message:** `\"It's a tie!! WOMP WOMP try again...\"`\n",
    "        *   **Required Choice Print:** `\"Player 1 chose Rock.\"`, `\"Player 2 chose Scissors.\"`\n",
    "        *   **Your Choice Print:** `f\"player 1 chose {player_1}, while player 2 chose {player_2}. let's see who's LUCKY!!\"`\n",
    "        *   **Required Win Message:** `\"Player 1 wins!\"` (or `\"Player 2 wins!\"`)\n",
    "        *   **Your Win Message:** `\"Player 1 is the winner winner chicken dinner! better luck next time player 2...\"`\n",
    "    *   **How to Fix It:** Simply adjust your `print()` statements to match the exact wording specified in the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Input Prompt Wording**\n",
    "    *   **The Problem:** Similar to output messages, the input prompts were also slightly different from the sample.\n",
    "        *   **Required:** `\"Player 1, choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors: \"`\n",
    "        *   **Your Prompt:** `\"Player 1, Decide your FATE!: \"`\n",
    "    *   **How to Fix It:** Update your `input()` prompts to match the sample. This also helps guide the user on what valid options are.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Let's See Your Current Code in Action (Sample Output):**\n",
    "\n",
    "If Player 1 types \"rock\" and Player 2 types \"Scissors\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE MOST CLASSICAL GAME KNOWN TO MANKIND. so classical, that your ancestors used it to decide who would eat the last bit of wolly mammoth!\n",
    "your options are as follows: Rock, Paper or Scissors. easy enough eh.\n",
    "Player 1, Decide your FATE!: rock\n",
    "Player 2, Select your WEAPON!: Scissors\n",
    "player 1 chose rock, while player 2 chose Scissors. let's see who's LUCKY!!\n",
    "Player 2 steals the victory! get better player 1! \n",
    "```\n",
    "*Note how Player 2 incorrectly wins because \"rock\" (lowercase) doesn't match \"Rock\", so the `elif` condition is skipped, and it falls into the `else` block.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Recommendations for Your Next Attempt:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can modify your code to meet all the requirements, focusing on the input validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Define Valid Choices:** Start by making a list of valid choices to check against.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    VALID_CHOICES = [\"Rock\", \"Paper\", \"Scissors\"]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2.  **Normalize and Validate Input:** After getting input from each player, convert it to a consistent format (e.g., capitalize the first letter) and check if it's in `VALID_CHOICES`. If not, print the error and exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    player_1_raw = input(\"Player 1, choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors: \")\n",
    "    player_1 = player_1_raw.capitalize() # This will convert \"rock\" to \"Rock\", \"ROCK\" to \"Rock\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    if player_1 not in VALID_CHOICES:\n",
    "        print(\"ERROR: Invalid choice.\")\n",
    "        exit() # Or you could use a loop to re-prompt\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Do the same for player 2\n",
    "    player_2_raw = input(\"Player 2, choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors: \")\n",
    "    player_2 = player_2_raw.capitalize()\n",
    "\n",
    "    if player_2 not in VALID_CHOICES:\n",
    "        print(\"ERROR: Invalid choice.\")\n",
    "        exit() # Or you could use a loop to re-prompt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  **Adjust Print Statements:** Go through all your `print()` statements and make sure they exactly match the sample outputs for choices, ties, and wins/losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're very close to a perfect solution! Focus on that input validation and exact output wording, and you'll nail it. Keep up the great work!"
